Final project from the ruby course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project)

The notation for the movements are letter first, then number e.g 'a2'

Completed using a graph as a board, minimal tests because I'm not used to them yet, couldn't upload it to replit since I use methods that do not exist yet in replit ruby version.
